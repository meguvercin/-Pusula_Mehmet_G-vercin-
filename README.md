Data Science Intern Case Study


# Pusula Drug Side Effects Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis on a dataset of drug side effects and prepare the data for further predictive modeling. The following stages were implemented in order:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization techniques were used to explore the data and understand the data structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Operations such as filling in missing data, converting categorical data to numerical data, and scaling numerical data were performed.

## Installation and Requirements
The project is written in Python programming language and the following libraries are used:

- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

You can run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project code:

Download the project files and place them in a suitable directory.
Go to the project directory in terminal or command line.
Run drug_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to process the data.
Project Phases
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data structure was examined: The general structure of the data was examined using Pandas.
Missing data detection: Missing data was visualized with heatmap.
Data visualization: Relationships between side effects and drugs were analyzed with various graphs.
2. Data Preprocessing
Filling missing data: Missing data was filled with SimpleImputer.
Digitizing categorical data: Categorical data was converted to numerical values ​​with OneHotEncoder.
Scaling numerical data: Numerical data was normalized with StandardScaler.
Using Pipeline: A modular and reusable structure was created using the data processing steps pipeline.
3. Results
The data was successfully processed and made ready for modeling. The obtained data can be used to train various predictive models.
